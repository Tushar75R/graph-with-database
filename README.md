# graph-with-database
we connect graph with database using postgresql. and impliment run time analysis that how time it will take for BFS and DFS from data base.
we first connect java with postgresql and then generate graph in data base using two table one is for vertices and another is for edges.
from small to large we analyze that DFS is slightly faster then BFS.
here the result that we get  : 
for BFS :

and for DFS :

// in this we create graph using direct database not store in realtime so much space optimized.
